# directory_tree_integrity_check

A little python script that does exactly what it says: 

it calculates the SHA1 hashes of every file it finds traversing the directory tree starting from where the script is executed, then writes them to a file. It can also calculate the hashes again and check them against the one that are in the file.

Use it as you want, this is MIT licensed.

Also, props to StackExchange user janosâ™¦ for reviewing my code.
